# 📊 Applied-statistics
Collection of my data engineering projects.

## 📋 Overview

This repository stores projects in which data is extracted, rigorously prepared, and subsequently shared 
so that it can be used by data scientists. The use of pipelines is essential to ensure an efficient and 
organized workflow.

These projects feature data pipelines, and in some cases, the data is loaded into MySQL Workbench to enable querying.

Currently, the repository includes:

1. **Hotel Reservation System** – A Python-MySQL system for managing hotel bookings.  
2. **World Bank Data Pipeline** – An end-to-end pipeline fetching, cleaning, and storing global indicators in MySQL for analysis.

Each project includes scripts, example data, SQL tables, and explanations of the workflow.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- API integration and data retrieval  
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Database design and connection  
- SQL queries for analysis  
- Python-SQL integration  
- Basic data exploration  

## 📖 Databases

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) – Used for storing structured datasets and performing queries.  
- Example datasets are retrieved from:  
  - [World Bank API](https://data.worldbank.org/)  
  - Synthetic hotel reservation data (simulated for practice)

## 📂 Folders

- `Hotel_Reservation_System/` – Python scripts, SQL scripts, and instructions for the hotel booking system.  
- `World_Bank_Pipeline/` – Python pipeline scripts, notebooks for exploration, and SQL scripts for table creation and queries.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python (.py files, Jupyter notebooks)** – Scripting and interactive analysis  
- **SQL / MySQL Workbench** – Database creation and queries  
- **Python Libraries**:  
    - **pandas** – Data manipulation  
    - **numpy** – Numerical operations  
    - **requests** – API calls  
    - **matplotlib & seaborn** – Data visualization  
    - **mysql-connector-python** – Python-MySQL connection  
    - **datetime** – Date handling and validation  

## 📌 Notes

- All datasets used are public or simulated.  
- Scripts include comments to explain each step of the workflow.  
- Pipelines are modular and reusable for other datasets or indicators.  

## 🎖️ Conclusions

These projects showcase core **data engineering skills** including data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and database storage. They provide a strong foundation for working with structured data in real-world environments.
