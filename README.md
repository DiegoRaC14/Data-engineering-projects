# 📊 Applied-statistics
Collection of my data engineering projects.

## 📋 Overview

This repository stores projects in which data is extracted, rigorously prepared, and subsequently shared 
so that it can be used by data scientists. The use of pipelines is essential to ensure an efficient and 
organized workflow.

These projects feature data pipelines, and in some cases, the data is loaded into MySQL Workbench to enable querying.
